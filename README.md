What is Customer Churning ?


Customer churn (or customer attrition) refers to the loss of customers or subscribers for any reason at all.It is an industry-wide problem and a major contributor to EBITDA margin. 
A churned consumer boosts the market share of competitors and generates little to no money. If a customer leaves for a competitor, the service provider's acquisition costs would go up. Purchasing a new customer cost a service provider much more than keeping an existing one.Therefore it is important to manage and learn about the reasons a customer might be churning.
